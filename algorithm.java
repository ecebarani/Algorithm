			1..Find out the number entered by the user is divisible by 5


step 1:start.
step :declare the value of i and count as 0.
step 3:check the condition true or false.
step 4:check i is divisible by 5.
step 5:if yes, print i & increase the count.
step 6:when condition gets false,loop gets exit.
step 7:display the number divisible by 5.
step 8:stop.

			2..Display first 10 multiples of 9

step 1:start.
step 2:declare the value of num=9.
step 3:declare the value of result=0.
step 4:check the condition as(i=0;i<=10;i++).
step 5:if condition true,num*i=result.
step 6:if false,loop get exit.
step 7:display the output.
step 8:stop.

			3..find wheather the number entered by the user is odd or even

step 1:start.
step 2:read num.
step 3:if num divisible by 2.
step 4:display even.
step 5:if not display odd.
step 6:stop.

			4..algorithm to accept 2 numbers from the users,subract the 1st number by 2nd number

step 1:start.
step 2:get the two value from the user.
step 3:where the first value is greater than the second value.
step 4:declare first value as a, and second value as b. 
step 5:subract the first value from the second value.
step 6:stop.

			5..get the number from the user and display in cube

step 1:start.
step 2:get the value from the user as z.
step 3:multiply the value of z for 3 times.
step 4:display the result.
step 5:stop.

			6..find the factorial of the number

step 1:start.
step 2:read the numbers.
step 3:set factorial=1,i=1.
step 4:check the condition i<=number.if false go to step 7.
step 5:fact=fact*i
step 6:display i=i+1,then go to step 4.
step 7:display fact.
step 8:stop.
